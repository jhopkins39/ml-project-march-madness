    <h2 style="color:white; text-decoration:underline"> Background</h2>
        <p style="color:white;"> In many people’s opinions college basketball is the greatest sport: the kids
          fighting to win pride for their teammates in school, the unpredictability of who's going to win, 
          and of course the annual culmination of all the work they put in with the March Madness tournament.
          Part of the fun of the tournament is bracket challenges that every fan competes in. The 68 teams 
          that make the tournament are ranked and play in a bracket style tournament until one is left.  
          People compete against their friends to try to guess the winners of the tournament or at least 
          guess more than the friends.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:white; text-decoration:underline"> Dataset Explantaion </h2>
        <p style="color:white;"> Our data set, which we have downloaded from kaggle, includes many important
          features which describe a team.  It has the experience of the team by information such as how many
          of the players have played in a tournament before, their record, the strength of schedule, the NCAA
          ranking, the conference they play in, the point differential, the points allowed, the points scored,
          and many other basketball statistics.

    <h2 style="color:white; text-decoration:underline"> Problem Definition </h2>
        <p style="color:white;">The goal of our project is to predict the final four teams of the NCAA men’s 
          march madness tournament.  This could be very useful for people trying to beat out their friends in
          bracket challenges everywhere.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:white; text-decoration:underline"> Methods </h2>
      <p style="color:white;"> Right now there are a couple different methods we are looking at. The first method we are going to try is a logistic regression on the the team's seed in the tournament. We were also thinking about doing a random forest model (when we learn more hopefully) and even a neural net to give us the teams who will  prevail.
     </p>
    <h2 style="color:white; text-decoration:underline"> Potential Results and Discussion </h2>
    <p style="color:white;"> Hopefully the results can provide accurate predictions on who will advance to the final four.  If we’re guessing on the 68 teams that are selected to the tournament, this may be too simple because you are essentially guessing from only 17 teams which team will advance all the way four different times.  If this proves to be too easy (or impossible), we will then work on selecting the final four from end of season stats (excluding conference tournament).  This would be much more difficult, but much more interesting.
